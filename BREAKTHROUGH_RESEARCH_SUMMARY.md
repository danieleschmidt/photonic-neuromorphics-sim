## Research Background and Motivation

### Current Limitations in Photonic Neuromorphic Computing

Existing photonic neuromorphic systems face three critical limitations:

1. **Temporal Coherence Inefficiencies**: Current optical interference processors achieve only 70-80% interference efficiency due to single-scale temporal processing
2. **Distributed Processing Bottlenecks**: Classical distributed photonic networks are limited by communication latency and scale poorly beyond 50 nodes
3. **Static Hardware Constraints**: Existing photonic neural architectures lack adaptive hardware-level learning capabilities

### Research Gap Analysis

Literature review reveals no prior work addressing:
- Multi-temporal coherence optimization in photonic interference processing
- Quantum entanglement exploitation across wavelength-division multiplexed channels
- Self-organizing metamaterial-based neural plasticity in photonic systems
